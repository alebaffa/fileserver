==========
Test of web application written in Go and deployed (temporarily) on Heroku.
https://helpthesheriff.herokuapp.com/.

## Prerequisites
* [Go latest version](https://golang.org/doc/install): the backend is written in Go. I think it's compatible also with older versions, but there's no reason to not use the latest one.
* [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/): to push to heroku server using Git.
* [Account on Heroku](http://heroku.com/): to create a new app.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/): the frontend is a bootstrap theme customized.

## Install
